Description: This package implements functions to analyzing multi-omics epigenetic data. 
    Data of fragment type and base type are supported by epiSeeker. 
    It provide function to retrieve the nearest genes around the peak, annotate genomic region of the peak, 
    statstical methods for estimate the significance of overlap among peak data sets, and motif analysis.
    It incorporate GEO database for user to compare the own dataset with those deposited in database. 
    The comparison can be used to infer cooperative regulation and thus can be used to generate hypotheses. 
    Several visualization functions are implemented to summarize the coverage of the
    peak experiment, average profile and heatmap of peaks binding to TSS
    regions, genomic annotation, distance to TSS, overlap of peaks or genes, and
    the single-base resolution epigenetic data by considering the strand, motif, and additional information.
