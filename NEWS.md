# epiSeeker 1.1.4

+ `annotateSeq()` keeps `annotation`, `geneChr/geneStart/geneEnd`, `geneId` and
  `transcriptId` consistent with each other at transcript level (issue #252 of
  ChIPseeker). The transcript id of an exon/intron/UTR hit was taken from
  `names(genomicRegion)[subjectIndex]`, indexing the unlisted ranges with the
  names of the `GRangesList`; this mostly returned NA and occasionally a wrong
  transcript, so a peak could be reported with the metadata of an unrelated
  transcript (even on another chromosome). The ids are now expanded before
  indexing, and the same alignment is applied at `level = "gene"`, where the gene
  of the overlapping exon/intron/UTR is resolved with `TXID2EG()` and used
  instead of the nearest gene. (2026-10-01, Thu)
+ `seq2gene()` no longer fails with `$ operator is invalid for atomic vectors`
  when none of the queried regions overlaps an exon
  (`getGenomicAnnotation.internal()` returns `NA` then); host-gene extraction is
  skipped and the nearest/flanking genes are still reported (issue #248 of
  ChIPseeker). (2026-10-01, Thu)
+ `downloadGEObedFiles()`/`downloadGSMbedFiles()` rewrite the `ftp://` urls of
  `gsminfo$supplementary_file` to `https://` before downloading and report the
  underlying download error when a file cannot be fetched (issue #254 of
  ChIPseeker). (2026-10-01, Thu)
+ Documented the distance definition of `flank_gene_distances` reported by
  `annotateSeq(..., addFlankGeneInfo = TRUE)`: a distance of 0 means that the
  peak overlaps the feature range - at `level = "transcript"` the feature is the
  whole transcript, which is why most entries can be 0 - while non-overlapping
  peaks get the signed distance to the feature TSS (issue #235 of ChIPseeker).
  (2026-10-01, Thu)
+ `annotateSeq()` no longer fails with `Error: invalid subscript` when *every*
  peak is dropped, which typically happens because none of the seqlevels of the
  peaks matches `TxDb` (`chr1` vs `NC_000001.11`): `.get_distance_to_gene_end()`
  no longer hands the `SortedByQueryHits` object returned by `follow()` for an
  empty query to `features[]`, and `annotateSeq()` reports the seqlevels mismatch
  together with how to align the chromosome names (`seqlevelsStyle()`).
  (2026-10-01, Thu)
+ `enrichPeakOverlap()`/`enrichAnnoOverlap()` accept a single `GRanges` as
  `targetPeak`: it was passed on unwrapped while the overlap code works on a
  list of target peak sets, so the call failed with "GRanges objects don't
  support [[, as.list(), lapply()". The documentation of `enrichPeakOverlap()`
  and `enrichAnnoOverlap()` now also states the direction of the test (the
  observed ratio is the fraction of *target* peaks covered by the query peaks and
  the target is the shuffled set, so `N_OL` is direction free while the p-value
  is not) and that `N_OL` of `enrichAnnoOverlap()` counts genes and can therefore
  exceed the number of input peaks (issue #84 of ChIPseeker).
  (2026-10-01, Thu)
+ `enrichPeakOverlap()` gained an opt-in `symmetric` argument. With
  `symmetric = TRUE` the mirrored direction (query and target exchanged) is
  computed as well and the two one-sided permutation p-values are combined as
  `min(1, 2*min(p, p_rev))` (Hedges), so the result no longer depends on the order
  of the arguments. The default stays `FALSE` (one-sided) and all existing numbers
  are unchanged; the mirrored test doubles the number of permutations and raises
  the smallest reportable p-value to `2/(nShuffle+1)`. `enrichAnnoOverlap()` needs
  no such argument, its hypergeometric p-value is already exactly symmetric (issue
  #84 of ChIPseeker). (2026-10-01, Thu)

# epiSeeker 1.1.3

+ `annotateSeq()` now reports `geneChr` and `geneStrand` as characters instead of
  factor codes. `as.data.frame()` returns 'seqnames'/'strand' as factors and
  assigning a factor into `mcols()` dropped the class, so both columns came out
  as integers (e.g. `geneStrand` = 1/2 instead of +/-, and a wrong `geneChr`
  whenever the seqlevels were not in numeric order). (2026-09-15, Tue)
+ `annotateSeq()` now warns when peaks are dropped because no feature of `TxDb`
  can be found for them (e.g. peaks on contigs/scaffolds without genes, or a
  seqlevels style mismatch). Previously they disappeared silently. (2026-09-15, Tue)
+ `annotateSeq(..., sameStrand = TRUE)` no longer assigns a peak to a feature on
  the opposite strand. Overlap detection in `getNearestFeatureIndicesAndDistances()`
  was calling `findOverlaps()` with `unstrand(features)`, which bypassed `sameStrand`
  and overrode the strand-aware nearest-feature result. Peaks with ambiguous
  strand (`*`) are unaffected and still match features on any strand.
  (2026-09-15, Tue)
+ `plotAnnoBar()` no longer uses the deprecated `ggplot2::aes_string()`. It follows
  the tidy evaluation idiom already used by `plotDistToTSS()`. (2026-09-15, Tue)
+ dropped unused `@importFrom` directives with no call site (`aplot::xlim2`,
  `ggplot2::geom_segment`, `ggplot2::geom_text`, `ggplot2::scale_fill_hue`,
  `utils::getFromNamespace`) and a duplicate `ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer`. The
  `grid::unit()` import, previously declared in `upsetplot()` which never used it,
  now sits in `plotBmProf()` where `unit()` is actually called, keeping `grid` a
  genuine import. (2026-09-17, Thu)

# epiSeeker 1.1.2

+ documentation build migrated to roxygen2 8.1.0 (re-generated Rd pages and
  NAMESPACE; fixed `csAnno` class `@aliases` to be a single line); the exported
  API is unchanged

  `overlap=="all"` were silently overridden by the `overlap=="TSS"` branch,
  causing the two modes to behave identically (2026-09-07, Mon)

    - epiSeeker merges multiple functions to plot profile (getTagMatrix + plotPeakProf/plotPeakHeatmap), and add featrues of dealing missing data and different statistic methods to combind data
    - epiSeeker provides new features for plotCov to plot cluster tree and peak co-accessibility
    - epiSeeekr provides interactive function for user to explore data
    - epiSeeker provides functions to plot gene structure, base modification and motif
